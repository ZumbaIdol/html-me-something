				<h1>How Comics Helped to Shape My Intelligence</h1></br>

				
<p>My mother bought me my first comic book when I was 8 years old; it was an Avengers comic book.</p>
<p>This is more than likely why the Avengers are my favorite superhero group.</p>
<p>My 2nd oldest brother, Cornell, introduced me to the X-Men soon after.  I thought they were pretty cool, also.</P>
<p>I sincerely believe that reading comics enhanced my vocabulary, reading, spelling, and comprehension skills.</p>
<p>There are a lot of complex story lines and mature vocabulary in comics; I often had to look up many words in a dictionary
   in order to understand the plots in their fullness.</p>
   I am still a huge fan of superhero comics to this day at age 54!  You can probably tell by the number of shirts, watches,
   socks, and other paraphenalia that I own.  Kids should read comics to become smarter and develop improved language arts skills.</p>

<p>There’s been a stigma against comic books in America, says Wiley Miller, comic artist and author of the Ordinary Basil 
series, whether because we don’t recognize comics as appropriate or serious reading, or because we think other books are 
more valid. Either way, he says, “trying to dissuade kids from reading comics is silly and juvenile—it hurts kids.”</p>

<p>But today, comics are gaining respect in the educational community. “The idea of using comic books as an educational tool
isn’t new,” says Michael Bitz, founder of the Comic Book Project at the Columbia University School of Education. “What is 
new is the larger embrace of comics as literature.”</p>

<p>There’s more desire to bring the medium into the classroom than ever, agrees James Bucky Carter, Ph.D., author of Building
Literacy Connections with Graphic Novels: Page by Page, Panel by Panel. “The institution of traditional education and 
print-based education is still dominating, but I see more and more teachers asking how they can introduce comics.”</p>

<p>As literature, comics are “a layering of text, visual and pictoral,” says Carter. And don’t think you can just skim a comic
book. The words and illustrations are meant to be “read” together. “As long as you’re reading comics, you’re using visual 
literacy skills,” says Carter, whether that’s interpreting Batman’s facial expressions or imagining what’s happening in a 
description of a science experiment.</p>

<p>Kids are at ease with combining visual and text information, and as new media becomes mainstream, comic books offer a way 
to reinforce traditional grammar and spelling within a layout that’s familiar to kids. “Every year there are new literacies,
” says Bitz, and “when you look at a comic book, you can see how it’s a storyboard for a film, or a Web-based media project.
There are connections to media literacy all along the way.” Comics help 21st-century kids relate to big themes and topics by
tapping into the way students are already learning naturally.</p>
